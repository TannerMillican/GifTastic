It's Gif-TASTIC!!!

In this app, there are six buttons, each with different brands of cars assigned to them. 

There is also an input area where you can add additional brands of cars.

You can click on the existing buttons, or put in your own desired brand and click the "Add Brand" button.

Clicking any of these buttons (or any new buttons you create by adding your own desired brand button) will bring up 10 seperate gifs associated with that brand of car, along with a rating for the gif.

When the gifs appear, they will be animated. 

If the user clicks on the gifs, they will stop being animated, and instead, be static images. 

The user can then click on the gifs again to return them to their animated state.
